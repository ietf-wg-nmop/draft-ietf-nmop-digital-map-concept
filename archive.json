At this moment in time, it is not fully clear to me whether the digital map is intended to be:\r\n> \r\n> \u2022\taimed at supporting the full lifecycle of network management/control (as it seems to me being stated in the draft) or just the network visualization application (as I have understood from previous discussions and PoCs)\r\n> \r\n> \u2022\taddressing only network scenarios with L2&L3 technologies (as I have understood from previous discussions) or any network scenarios where TE layers, such as WDM, OTN or MPLS-TE, are also present (as I would assume by reading the draft as technology-agnostic)\r\n> \r\n> \u2022\taddressing only the applicability of topology models in support of digital twins (as it seems to me being stated in the draft) or more than just topology (as I have understood from previous discussions)\r\n> \r\n> IMHO, the NMOP WG should take on this draft and improve it to clarify all the points as well as other doubts I have seen from other comments sent to the list(s) as replies to this WG adoption call\r\n> \r\n> Italo\r\n",

I think we should qualify it a little bit more, and would suggest \u201cnetwork functional map\u201d, \u201cnetwork multi-level topology map\u201d, \u201cnetwork integrated map\u201d, or any similar combination, avoiding the so much overused term \u201cdigital\u201d and emphasizing the goals of the mapping mechanisms.\r\n> \r\n> Be goode,\r\n",
