If there is any concept or nuance not included in the definition of \"network topology\" \r\n        as derived from the basic (dictionary?) definitions of \"network\" and \"topology\", it should be denoted in the name and not by \r\n        redefining the term. Otherwise, it is fair to \"recall\" other sources but no more than that.\r\n\r\nDan:\r\n        Section 2 of RFC7399 is what I though digital map definition was - augmented by nodes relationships, LSDB basically.  \r\n        What should be added for digital map definition ?\r\n\r\nAdrian:\r\n          We wrote 7399 partly because there were some ambiguities in the TE world. Funnily (?) we failed to address the \r\n          issue of a  definition for \"topology\" in 9522.\r\n          Places I might have hoped to see topology defined include 5212, 5440, 5693, 7926, and 9552. But, sadly not.\r\n          I suppose my concern is that 7399 defines \"topology\" only by an indirection through the definition of \"TED\".\r\n          Anything we do in NMOP should certainly be compatible with that text, and ideally not perturbate the many RFCs \r\n          that use the  term \"network topology\". But a short, precise definition \r\n          (perhaps together with a pointer to 7399) might be helpful.",

In such a case, it would be beneficial being able to navigate among the different level of abstractions (e.g., to understand which set of nodes in the native topology are actually represented as a single node in an abstract topology being built on top of the native topology).\r\n\r\nThis navigation is different and orthogonal to the multi-layer navigation where for example we need to report which L2 path is supporting a given L3 node\r\n\r\nMy question is therefore: is SIMAP only dealing with native topologies and navigation among the different networking layers (L3, L2, optical, ...) or also dealing with abstract topologies and navigation among the different level of abstraction?\r\n",
