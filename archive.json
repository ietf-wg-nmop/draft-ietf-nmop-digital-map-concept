My thoughts for this is that people will find the map useful independent of the twin capabilities.

I'd suggest the more inclusive optional. \r\n\r\n- Nacho:\r\nThere were multiple discussions with Nacho in regards to how the Digital Map needs to be better defined to understand both its scope and relationship to Twin.\r\n \r\n\r\n",

If there is any concept or nuance not included in the definition of \"network topology\" \r\n        as derived from the basic (dictionary?) definitions of \"network\" and \"topology\", it should be denoted in the name and not by \r\n        redefining the term. Otherwise, it is fair to \"recall\" other sources but no more than that.\r\n\r\nDan:\r\n        Section 2 of RFC7399 is what I though digital map definition was - augmented by nodes relationships, LSDB basically.  \r\n        What should be added for digital map definition ?\r\n\r\nAdrian:\r\n          We wrote 7399 partly because there were some ambiguities in the TE world. Funnily (?) we failed to address the \r\n          issue of a  definition for \"topology\" in 9522.\r\n          Places I might have hoped to see topology defined include 5212, 5440, 5693, 7926, and 9552. But, sadly not.\r\n          I suppose my concern is that 7399 defines \"topology\" only by an indirection through the definition of \"TED\".\r\n          Anything we do in NMOP should certainly be compatible with that text, and ideally not perturbate the many RFCs \r\n          that use the  term \"network topology\". But a short, precise definition \r\n          (perhaps together with a pointer to 7399) might be helpful.",

We also found it challenging separating network partitioning,\n\nIn TAPI we concluded that several technology layers could be grouped into a single toplology (hence multi-layer). There are degrees of this, some very obvious and some not so.\n\nWhen you get IP over IP, this can be considered as one layer because of technology or several because of partitioning.\n\nThis may lead us to viewpoint, where from one viewpoint it is a single layer whereas from another it is multople layers.",

In such a case, it would be beneficial being able to navigate among the different level of abstractions (e.g., to understand which set of nodes in the native topology are actually represented as a single node in an abstract topology being built on top of the native topology).\r\n\r\nThis navigation is different and orthogonal to the multi-layer navigation where for example we need to report which L2 path is supporting a given L3 node\r\n\r\nMy question is therefore: is SIMAP only dealing with native topologies and navigation among the different networking layers (L3, L2, optical, ...) or also dealing with abstract topologies and navigation among the different level of abstraction?\r\n",

I see in RFC8345 there are statements, but I find them ambiguous. For example \" An example of a termination point might be a physical or logical port or, more generally, an interface.\". I think we need to be much clearer here. \n\nPhysical should be something that has spatial dimensions. A termination point never has. It can be an abstraction that always represents some logical view. \n\nI also think that an interface as defined in other RFCs has a different definition to termination point in RFC8345. This relates to the challenge we had recently on whether termination should represent the same concept as the ONF/ITU-T LTP (G.7711) and hence could be specialized to both TAPI NEP (Link End) and TAPI CEP (termination functions) or just the TAPI NEP. \n\nIf the latter, then the generalized representation of generalized function is missing in IETF. If it is both NEP and CEP etc. then it could be quite similar to the full ONF LTP (which is a multi-layer full functionality representation of termination which can take a variety of subset forms including the CEP and the NEP forms) although more skeletal. We could argue that this then represents the skeleton of an interface which is a multi-layer, multi-function termination capability (where there is a restriction as to which subsets are allowed). \n\nWe found in ONF and ITU-T that it was vital to clarify this. We need to be clear on this. I have previously engaged in this challenge and we were successful in clarifying. I could take a shot here if other think beneficial.",

These are functional requirements translated into the requirements for the model designer. The reason for doing this is to ensure that the YANG module is designed according to the core requirements, and that it could be used for both design and review of the proposed YANG module. I agree there is some duplication and we at one interim meeting did mention to remove REQ-RELATIONSHIP. I suggest to change the REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE description to: SIMAP must provide capability to navigate inside the topology layer and between the topology layers. That would translate into REQ-RELATIONSHIP and some other. \n \n1.\tThe following is the quote from the draft: \nThe following are design requirements for modelling the SIMAP.  Theey\nare derived from the core requerements collected from the operators\n                                                      and although there is some duplication, these are focused on\n                                                    summarizing the requirements for the design of the model and API:\n \n3.\tArchitecture requirements \u2013 it was added as some operators were mentioning performance, scale and network discovery \u2013 which are really not requirements for the YANG module and API itself, they are more requirements on the controller that provides the SIMAP API. They are commons sense requirements for any controller, therefore I am not sure if we want to keep them here as well. \n \nWe can discuss if we need to keep the different categories of requirements as this or merge them. I personally think that it can be useful to have the functional requirements as collected from the operators and design requirements (or  model requirements) derived specifically for how the model the SIMAP YANG.\n \nThere may be some missing, we need to see if we want to add the ones we found during the PoC as gaps to the design requirements (bdir, mtptp, cross-domain, etc).\n \nBest regards,\nOlga\n \n \nFrom: [mohamed.boucadair@orange.com](mailto:mohamed.boucadair@orange.com) <[mohamed.boucadair@orange.com](mailto:mohamed.boucadair@orange.com)> \nSent: Tuesday, December 3, 2024 2:58 PM\nTo: [nmop@ietf.org](mailto:nmop@ietf.org)\nSubject: [NMOP] SIMAP: REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE vs REQ-RELATIONSHIPS\n \nHi SIMAP Authors, all,\n(as a contributor)\n \nIs there a value in keeping these two req as they seems to be redundant?\n \n \n   REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE:  SIMAP must provide intra-layer and inter-layer\n      relationships.\n \nvs.\n \n   REQ-RELATIONSHIPS:  SIMAP should contain all topological\n      relationships inside each layer or between the layers (underlay/\n      overlay)\n \n      SIMAP should contain links to other models/data to enable generic\n      navigation to other YANG models in generic way.\n \nCheers,\nMed",

      "body": "\nFrom @graf3net:\n\nFrom a network operators requirements perspective, I think the requirements list is pretty much complete. \n\nI only have one comment:\n\nREQ-SEMANTIC:\nSIMAP must provide semantics for layered network topologies and for linking external models/data.\n\nI think we need to expand or add additional requirements to ensure that the following is covered:\n\n\u2022\tProvider data plane (Flow) needs to be correlatable to underlay and customer data plane to overlay topology \n\u2022\tUnderlay control plane routing state needs to be correlatable to underlay L3 topology. Overlay control-plane routing state needs to be correlate-able to overlay L3 network topology \n\nAs an example:\n\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7011#section-8\n\n   If an Information Element is required more than once in a Template,\n   the different occurrences of this Information Element SHOULD follow\n   the logical order of their treatments by the Metering Process.  For\n   example, if a selected packet goes through two hash functions, and if\n   the two hash values are sent within a single Template, the first\n   occurrence of the hash value should belong to the first hash function\n   in the Metering Process.  For example, when exporting the two source\n   IP addresses of an IPv4-in-IPv4 packet, the first sourceIPv4Address\n   Information Element occurrence should be the IPv4 address of the\n   outer header, while the second occurrence should be the address of\n   the inner header.  Collecting Processes MUST properly handle\n   Templates with multiple identical Information Elements.\n\n\nIn a SRv6 enabled network, sourceIPv6Address appears in a IPFIX data-template/data-record for a captured flow on a SRv6 enabled provider interface twice. Once in relation to provider data plane in the underlay, and once as relation to the customer data plane in the overlay.\n\nSIMAP must provide the semantic capability that each sourceIPv6Address can be mapped to the overlay and underlay network topology. Both topologies might not be uniquely addressed, the VPN context (in SRv6 these are the SID's, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8986#name-srv6-sid) needs to be considered therefore as well.\n\nThe same requirement also applies to the control plane. Taking BMP/BGP as an example. The BMP peer distinguisher (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7854#section-4.2) needs to be correlateable to the VRF of a node and the next-hop attribute of the NLRI in the BMP route-monitoring (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7854#section-4.6) encapsulated message to the underlay network topology while the path attribute of the NLRI in the BMP route-monitoring encapsulated message to the overlay topology.\n\nI think REQ-SEMANTIC describes that requirement very high level, but I suggest to expand the description, maybe with examples I described to establish more clarity.\n\nI agree with REQ-TOPO-ONLY that dynamic paths are outside of SIMAP scope. However as part of REQ-SEMANTIC, it lays the foundation to map it as external data.\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\nBest wishes\nThomas\n",
