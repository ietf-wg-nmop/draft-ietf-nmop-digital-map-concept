1.  Introduction

   Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP) is a data model that provides a
   view of the operator's networks and services, including how it is
   connected to other models/data (e.g., inventory, observability
   sources, and operational knowledge).  It specifically provides an
   approach to model multi-layered topology and appropriate mechanism to
   navigate amongst layers and correlate between them.  This includes
   layers from physical topology to service topology.  This model is
   applicable to multiple domains (access, core, data center, etc.) and
   technologies (Optical, IP, etc.).

   The SIMAP modelling defines the core topological entities (network,
   node, link, and interface) at each layer, their role in the network
   topology, core topological properties, and topological relationships
   both inside each layer and between the layers.  It also defines how
   to access other external models from a topology.  The SIMAP model is
   a topological model that is linked to the other functional models and
   connects them all: configuration, maintenance, assurance (KPIs,
   status, health, and symptoms), Traffic-Engineering (TE), different
   behaviors and actions, simulation, emulation, mathematical
   abstractions, AI algorithms, etc.  These other models exist outside
   of the SIMAP and are not defined during SIMAP modelling.

   The SIMAP data consists of virtual instances of network and service
   topologies at different layers.  The SIMAP provides access to this
   data via standard APIs for both read and write operations (write
   operations for offline simulations, typically), with query
   capabilities and links to other YANG modules (e.g., Service Assurance
   for Intent-based Networking (SAIN) [RFC9417], Service Attachment
   Points (SAPs) [RFC9408], Inventory
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang], and non-YANG models).

2.  Terminology

   The document makes use of the following terms:

   Topology:  Topology in this document refers to the network and
      service topology.  A network topology defines how physical or
      logical nodes, links and interfaces are related and arranged.  A
      Service topology defines how service components (e.g., VPN
      instances, customer interfaces, and customer links) between
      customer sites are interrelated and arranged.

      There are several types of topologies: point-to-point, bus, ring,
      star, tree, mesh, hybrid, and daisy chain.

      Topologies may be unidirectional or bidirectional (bus, some
      rings).

   Multi-layered topology:  A multi-layered topology models
      relationships between different topology layers, where each layer
      represents a connectivity aspect of the network and services that
      needs to be configured, controlled and monitored.  Each topology
      layer has a separate lifecycle.

   Topology layer:  Represents topology at a single layer in the multi-
      layered topology.

      The topology layer can also represent what needs to be managed by
      a specific user or application, for example IGP layer can be of
      interest to the operator troubleshooting or optimizing the
      routing, while the optical layer may be of interest to the user
      managing the optical network.

      Some topology layers may relate closely to OSI layers, like L1
      topology for physical topology, Layer 2 for link topology and
      Layer 3 for IPv4 and IPv6 topologies.

      Some topology layers represent the control aspects of Layer 3,
      like OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP.

      The service layer represents the service view of the connectivity,
      that can differ for different types of services and for different
      providers/solutions.

      The top layer represents the application/flow view of service
      connectivity.

   Service:  Represents network connectivity service provided over a
      network that enables devices, systems, or networks to communicate
      and exchange data with each other.  It provides the underlying
      infrastructure and mechanisms necessary for establishing,
      maintaining, and managing connections between different endpoints.
      The example services are: L2VPN, L3VPN, EVPN, VPLS, VPWS,

   Subservice:  Represents component of the service that can be
      independently managed but is not provided as a service.  The
      example subservices are: MPLS Tunnels, SRV6 Tunnels, VRFs, VPN
      Links, IGP Links.

   Resource:  Defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology]

   The document defines the following terms:

   Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP):  SIMAP is a data model that
      provides a view of the operator's networks and services, including
      how it is connected to other models/data (e.g., inventory,
      observability sources, and operational knowledge).  It
      specifically provides an approach to model multi-layered topology
      and appropriate mechanism to navigate amongst layers and correlate
      between them.  This includes layers from physical topology to
      service topology.

      This model is applicable to multiple domains (access, core, data
      centers, etc.) and technologies (Optical, IP, etc.).

   SIMAP modelling:  The set of principles, guidelines, and conventions
      to model the SIMAP using the IETF modelling approach [RFC8345].
      They cover the network types (layers and sublayers), entity types,
      entity roles (network, node, termination point, or link), entity
      properties, relationship types between entities and relationships
      to other entities.

   SIMAP model:  Defines the core topological entities, their role in
      the network, core topological properties, and relationships both
      inside each layer and between the layers.

      It is the basic topological model with references/pointers to
      other models and connects them all: configuration, maintenance,
      assurance (KPIs, status, health, symptoms, etc.), traffic
      engineering, different behaviors, simulation, emulation,
      mathematical abstractions, AI algorithms, etc.

   SIMAP data:  Consists of instances of network and service topologies
      at different layers.  This includes instances of networks, nodes,
      links and termination points, topological relationships between
      nodes, links and termination points inside a network,
      relationships between instances belonging to different networks,
      links to functional data for the instances, including
      configuration, health, symptoms.

      The SIMAP data can be historical, real-time, or future data for
      'what-if' scenarios.

3.  Sample SIMAP Use Cases

   The following are sample use cases that require SIMAP:

   *  Generic inventory queries

   *  Service placement feasibility checks

   *  Service-> subservice -> resource

   *  Resource -> subservice -> service

   *  Intent/service assurance

   *  Service E2E and per-link KPIs on SIMAP (connectivity status, high-
      availability, delay, jitter, and loss)

   *  Capacity planning

   *  Network design

   *  Simulation

   *  Closed-loop

   *  Network Digital Twin (NDT)

   Overall, the SIMAP is needed to provide the mechanism to connect data
   islands from the core multi-layered topology.  It is a solution
   feasible and useful in the short-term for the existing operations use
   cases, but it is also a requirement for the SIMAP.

      The following subsections include some initial use case
      descriptions to initiate the discussion about what type of info is
      needed to describe the use cases in the context of SIMAP.  The
      next version of the draft will include more info on these use
      cases and more input from the operators, from the perspective of
      what the value of the SIMAP for each use case is and how the SIMAP
      API can be used.  This will also clarify if only read and if/when
      write interface is needed per use case.

3.1.  Inventory Queries

   Network inventory refers to a comprehensive record or database that
   tracks and documents all the network components and devices within an
   organization's IT infrastructure.

   Key elements typically found in a network inventory include: *
   Hardware Details: Descriptions of physical devices such as routers
   (including its internal components such as cards, power supply units,
   pluggables), switches, servers, network cables, including model
   numbers, serial numbers, and manufacturer information.  These
   information will facilitate locating additional details of the
   hadware in the manufacturer systems and the correlation with the
   purchase catalog of the company. * Software and Firmware: Versions of
   operating systems, network management tools, and firmware running on
   network devices.  Note that a network device can have components with
   their own software and firmware. * Licensing Information: For any
   licensed software or devices, the network inventory will track
   license numbers, expiry dates, and compliance.

   Network inventory lifecycle refers to the stages a network device or
   component goes through from its introduction to the network until its
   removal or replacement.  It encompasses everything from acquisition
   and deployment to maintenance, upgrade, and eventually
   decommissioning.  Managing the network inventory lifecycle
   efficiently is crucial for maintaining a secure, functional, and
   cost-effective network.

   A well-maintained network inventory helps organizations with network
   management, troubleshooting, asset tracking, security, and ensuring
   compliance with regulations.  It also helps in scaling the network,
   planning upgrades, and responding to issues quickly.  In order to
   facilitate the planning and troubleshooting processes it is necessary
   to be able to navigate from network inventory to network topology and
   services.

   The application will be able to retrieve physical topology from the
   controller via the SIMAP API and from the response it will be able to
   retrieve physical inventory of individual devices and cables.

   The application may request either one or multiple topology layers
   via the SIMAP API and from the response it will be able to retrieve
   both physical and logical inventory.

   For Access network providers the ability to have linkage in the SIMAP
   of the complete network (active + passive) is essential as it
   provides many advantages for optimized customer service, reduced Mean
   Time To Repair (MTTR), and lower operational costs through truck roll
   reduction.  For example, operators may use custom-tags that are
   readily available for a customer-facing device and then query the
   inventory based on that tag to correlate it with the inventory and
   then map it to the network/service topology.  The mapping and
   correlation can be then used for triggering apprpriate service
   checks.

3.2.  Service Placement Feasibility Checks

3.3.  Service-> Subservice -> Resource

   The application will be able to retrieve all services from the SIMAP
   API for selected network types.  The application will be able to
   retrieve the topology for selected services via SIMAP API and from
   the response it will be able to navigate via the supporting
   relationship top-down to the lower layers.  That way, it will be able
   to determine what logical resources are used by the service.  The
   supporting relations to the lowest layer will help application to
   determine what physical resources are used by the service.

3.4.  Resource -> Subservice -> Service

   The application will be able to navigate from the Physical, L2 or L3
   topology to the services that use specific resources.  For example,
   the application will be able to select the resource and by navigating
   the supporting relationship bottom-up come to the service and its
   nodes, tps and links.

3.5.  Intent/Service Assurance

   Network intent and service assurance work together to ensure that the
   network aligns with business goals and that the services provided
   meet the agreed-upon service level agreements (SLAs).

   The Service Assurance for Intent-Based Networking Architecture (SAIN)
   [RFC9417] approach emphasizes a comprehensive view of all components
   involved in service delivery, including network devices and
   functions, to effectively monitor and maintain service health.

   The key objectives of this architecture: * Holistic Service
   Monitoring: By considering all elements involved in service delivery,
   the architecture enables a thorough assessment of service health. *
   Correlation of Service Degradation: It assists in linking service
   performance issues to specific network components, facilitating
   precise identification of faults. * Impact Assessment: The
   architecture identifies which services are affected by the failure or
   degradation of particular network components, aiding in prioritizing
   remediation efforts.

   When a service is degraded, the SAIN architecture will highlight
   where in the assurance service graph to look, as opposed to going hop
   by hop to troubleshoot the issue.  More precisely, the SAIN
   architecture will associate to each service instance a list of
   symptoms originating from specific subservices, corresponding to
   components of the network.  These components are good candidates for
   explaining the source of a service degradation.

   The application will be able to retrieve topology layer and any
   network/node/termination point/link instances from the controller via
   the SIMAP API and from the response it will be able to determine the
   health of each instance by navigating to the SAIN subservices and its
   symptoms.

3.6.  Service E2E and Per-link KPIs

   The application will be able to retrieve the topology at any layer
   from the controller via the SIMAP API and from the response it will
   be able to navigate any retrieve any KPIs for selected topology
   entity.

3.7.  Capacity Planning

   Network Capacity Planning refers to the process of analyzing,
   predicting, and ensuring that the network has sufficient capacity
   (e.g., [RFC5136]), resources, and infrastructure to meet current and
   future demands.  It involves evaluating the network's ability to
   handle increasing (including forecast) amounts of data, traffic, and
   users activity, while maintaining acceptable levels of performance,
   reliability, and security.

   The capacity planning primary goal is to ensure that a network can
   support business operations, applications, and services without
   interruptions, delays, or degradation in quality.  This requires a
   thorough understanding of the network's current state, as well as
   future requirements and growth projections.

   Key aspects of network capacity planning include:

   *  Traffic analysis: Monitoring and analyzing network traffic
      patterns to identify trends, peak usage periods, and areas of
      congestion.  For example, by generating a core traffic matrix with
      IPFIX flow record [RFC7011] or deducting an approximate traffic
      matrix from the link utilization data.

   *  Resource utilization: Evaluating the link utilization throughout
      the network for the current demand identifying bottlenecks and
      potential QoS peformance issues.

   *  Growth forecasting: Predicting future network growth based on
      business expansion, new applications, or changes in users
      behavior.

   *  What-if scenarios: Creating models to assess the network behavior
      under different scenarios, such as increased traffic, failure
      conditions (link, router or Shared Risk Resource Group), and new
      application deployments (such as a new Content Delivery Network
      source, a new peering point, a new data center...).

   *  Upgrade planning: Identifying areas where upgrades or additions
      are needed to ensure that the network can minimize the effect of
      node/link failures, mitigate QoS problems, or simply to support
      growing demands.

   *  Cost-benefit analysis: Evaluating the costs and benefits of
      upgrading or adding new resources to determine the most cost-
      effective solutions.

   By implementing a robust capacity planning process, organizations
   can:

   *  Ensure better network reliability: Minimize downtime and ensure
      that the network is always available when needed.

   *  Improve performance: Optimize network resources to support
      business-critical applications and services.

   *  Optimize costs: Avoid unnecessary over-provisioning by making
      informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

   *  Support business growth: Scale the network to meet increasing
      demands and support business expansion.

   The application will be able to retrieve topology layer and any
   network/node/termination point/link instances from the controller via
   the SIMAP API and from the response it will be able to map the
   traffic analysis to the entities (typically links and router),
   evaluate their current utilization, based on the grow forecasting
   evaluate which elements to add to the network, and finally perform
   the 'what-if' failure analysis by simulating the removal of link(s)
   and/or router(s) while evaluating the network performance.

3.8.  Network design

3.9.  Network Simulation and Network Emulation

   Network simulation is a process used to analyse the behaviour of
   networks via software.  It allows network engineers and researchers
   to study how the network protocols work under different conditions,
   such as diffenet topologies, traffic loads, network failures, or the
   introduction of new devices.  Network emulation, on the other hand,
   replicates the behavior of a real-world network, allowing for more
   realistic analysis compared to network simulation.  While network
   simulation focuses on modeling and approximating network behavior,
   network emulation involves creating a real-time, functional network
   environment whose protocol behaves exactly like a real network.
   Ideally, network emulation uses the same software images as in the
   real network, but it could also be peformed (with less accuracy)
   using generic software.

3.9.1.  Types of Network simulation

   There are several types of network simulations, each designed to
   address specific needs and use cases.  Below are the main categories
   of network simulation: 1.  Discrete Event Simulation (DES): This is
   the most common type of network simulation.  It models a series of
   events that occur at specific points in time.  Each event triggers a
   change in the state of a network component (e.g. a link is down, a
   card fails, a packet arrives…).  2.  Continuous Simulation: In
   contrast to discrete event simulation, continuous simulation models
   systems where variables change continuously over time.  Network
   parameters like bandwidth, congestion, and throughput can be treated
   as continuous functions.  The main use case is to model certain
   aspects of network performance that evolve continuously, such as link
   speeds or delay distributions in links that are impacted by
   envirnnmental conditions (such as microwave or satellite links). 3.
   Monte Carlo Simulation: This type of simulation uses statistical
   methods to model and analyze networks under uncertain or variable
   conditions.  Monte Carlo simulations generate a large number of
   random samples to predict the performance of a network across
   multiple scenarios.  It is used for probabilistic analysis, risk
   assessment, and performance evaluation under uncertain conditions.
   ### Goals of Network simulation The simulations can be also
   classified depending on the goal of the simulation #### Network
   Protocol Analysis This type of simulation focuses on simulating
   specific networking protocols (IS-IS, OSPF, BGP, SR) to understand
   how they perform under different conditions.  It models the protocol
   operations and interactions among devices in the network.  For
   example, simulation can be used to asses the impact of changing a
   link metric.  Morever, specific features of the networking protocol
   can be tested.  For example, how fast-reroute performs in a given
   network topology.

3.9.1.1.  Traffic Simulation

   This simulation focuses on modelling traffic flow across the network,
   including packet generation, flow control, routing, and congestion.
   It aims to evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

   The main use is to model the impact of different types of traffic
   (e.g., voice, video, mobile data, web browsing) and understand how
   they affect the network's bandwidth and congestion levels.  It can be
   used to identify bottelnecks and assist the capacity planning
   process.

3.9.1.2.  Simulation of different topologies under normal and failure
          scenarios

   This type of simulation focuses on the structure and layout of the
   network itself.  It simulates different network topologies, such as
   mesh, horse-shoe, bus, star, or tree topologies, and their impact on
   the network's performance.  It can be used, together with the traffic
   simualtion to evaluate the most efficient topology for a network,
   under normal conditions and considering factors like fault tolerance.

4.  SIMAP Requirements

4.1.  Core Requirements

   The following are the core requirements for the SIMAP (note that some
   of them are supported by default by [RFC8345]):

   REQ-BASIC-MODEL-SUPPORT:  Basic model with network, node, link, and
      interface entity types.

      This means that users of the SIMAP model must be able to
      understand topology model at any layer via these core concepts
      only, without having to go to the details of the specific
      augmentations to understand the topology.

   REQ-LAYERED-MODEL:  Layered SIMAP, from physical network (ideally
      optical, layer 2, layer 3) up to service and intent views.

   REQ-PASSIVE-TOPO:  SIMAP must support topology of the complete
      network, including active and passive parts.

      For Access network providers the ability to have linkage in the
      SIMAP of the complete network (active + passive) is essential as
      it provides many advantages for optimized customer service,
      reduced MTTR, and lower operational costs through truck roll
      reduction.

   REQ-PROG-OPEN-MODEL:  Open and programmable SIMAP.

      This includes "read" operations to retrieve the view of the
      network, typically as application-facing interface of Software
      Defined Networking (SDN) controllers or orchestrators.

      It also includes "write" operations, not for the ability to
      directly change the SIMAP data (e.g., changing the network or
      service parameters), but for offline simulations, also known as
      what-if scenarios.

      Running a "what-if" analysis requires the ability to take
      snapshots and to switch easily between them.

      Note that there is a need to distinguish between a change on the
      SIMAP for future simulation and a change that reflects the current
      reality of the network.

   REQ-STD-API-BASED:  Standard based SIMAP Models and APIs, for multi-
      vendor support.

      SIMAP must provide the standard YANG APIs that provide for read/
      write and queries.  These APIs must also provide the capability to
      retrieve the links to external data/models.

   REQ-COMMON-APP:  SIMAP models and APIs must be common over different
      network domains (campus, core, data center, etc.).

      This means that clients of the SIMAP API must be able to
      understand the topology model of layers of any domain without
      having to understand the details of any technologies and domains.

   REQ-SEMANTIC:  SIMAP must provide semantics for layered network
      topologies and for linking external models/data.

   REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE:  SIMAP must provide intra-layer and inter-layer
      relationships.

   REQ-EXTENSIBLE:  SIMAP must be extensible with metadata.

   REQ-PLUGG:  SIMAP must be pluggable.  That is,

      *  Must connect to other YANG modules for inventory,
         configuration, assurance, etc.

      *  Given that no all involved components can be available using
         YANG, there is a need to connect SIMAP YANG model with other
         modelling mechanisms.

   REQ-GRAPH-TRAVERSAL:  SIMAP must be optimized for graph traversal for
      paths.  This means that only providing link nodes and source and
      sink relationships to termination-points may not be sufficient, we
      may need to have the direct relationship between the termination
      points or nodes.

4.2.  Design Requirements

   The following are design requirements for modelling the SIMAP.  They
   are derived from the core requirements collected from the operators
   and although there is some duplication, these are focused on
   summarizing the requirements for the design of the model and API:

   REQ-TOPO-ONLY:  SIMAP should contain only topological information.

      SIMAP is not required to contain all models and data required for
      all the management and use cases.  However, it should be designed
      to support adequate pointers to other functional data and models
      to ease navigating in the overall system.  For example:

      *  ACLs and Route Policies are not required to be supported in the
         SIMAP, they would be linked to the SIMAP

      *  Dynamic paths may either be outside of the SIMAP or part of
         traffic engineering data/models

   REQ-PROPERTIES:  SIMAP entities should mainly contain properties used
      to identify topological entities at different layers, identify
      their roles, and topological relationships between them.

   REQ-RELATIONSHIPS:  SIMAP should contain all topological
      relationships inside each layer or between the layers (underlay/
      overlay)

      SIMAP should contain links to other models/data to enable generic
      navigation to other YANG models in generic way.

   REQ-CONDITIONAL:  Provide capability for conditional retrieval of
      parts of SIMAP.

   REQ-TEMPO-HISTO:  Must support geo-spatial, temporal, and historical
      data.  The temporal and historical can also be supported external
      to the SIMAP.

4.3.  Architectural Requirements

   The following are the architectural requirements for the controller
   that provides SIMAP API:

   REQ-DM-SCALES:  Scale, performance, ease of integration.

   REQ-DM-DISCOVERY:  Initial discovery and dynamic (change only) synch
      with the physical network.

5.  Security Considerations

   As this document covers the SIMAP concepts, requirements, and use
   cases, there is no specific security considerations.  However, the
   RFC 8345 Security Considerations aspects will be useful when
   designing the solution.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Related IETF Activities

A.1.  Network Topology

   Interestingly, we could not find any network topology definition in
   IETF RFCs (not even in [RFC8345]) or Internet-Drafts.  However, it is
   mentioned in multiple documents.  As an example, in Overview and
   Principles of Internet Traffic Engineering [RFC9522], which mentions:

   |  To conduct performance studies and to support planning of existing
   |  and future networks, a routing analysis may be performed to
   |  determine the paths the routing protocols will choose for various
   |  traffic demands, and to ascertain the utilization of network
   |  resources as traffic is routed through the network.  Routing
   |  analysis captures the selection of paths through the network, the
   |  assignment of traffic across multiple feasible routes, and the
   |  multiplexing of IP traffic over traffic trunks (if such constructs
   |  exist) and over the underlying network infrastructure.  A model of
   |  network topology is necessary to perform routing analysis.  A
   |  network topology model may be extracted from:
   |  
   |  *  Network architecture documents
   |  
   |  *  Network designs
   |  
   |  *  Information contained in router configuration files
   |  
   |  *  Routing databases such as the link state database of an
   |     interior gateway protocol (IGP)
   |  
   |  *  Routing tables
   |  
   |  *  Automated tools that discover and collate network topology
   |     information.
   |  
   |  Topology information may also be derived from servers that monitor
   |  network state, and from servers that perform provisioning
   |  functions.

A.2.  Core SIMAP Components

   The following specifications are core for the SIMAP:

   *  IETF network model and network topology model [RFC8345]

   *  A YANG grouping for geographic location [RFC9179]

   *  IETF modules that augment [RFC8345] for different technologies:

      -  A YANG data model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies
         [RFC8795]

      -  A YANG data model for Layer 2 network topologies [RFC8944]

      -  A YANG data model for OSFP topology
         [I-D.ogondio-opsawg-ospf-topology]

      -  A YANG data model for IS-IS topology
         [I-D.ogondio-nmop-isis-topology]

A.3.  Additional SIMAP Components

   The SIMAP may need to link to the following models, some are already
   augmenting [RFC8345]:

   *  Service Attachment Point (SAP) [RFC9408], augments 'ietf-network'
      data model [RFC8345] by adding the SAP.

   *  SAIN [RFC9417] [RFC9418]

   *  Network Inventory Model [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang]
      focuses on physical and virtual inventory.  Logical inventory is
      currently outside of the scope.  It does not augment RFC8345 like
      the two Internet-Drafts that it evolved from
      [I-D.ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang] and
      [I-D.wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management].
      [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology] correlates the network
      inventory with the general topology via RFC8345 augmentations that
      reference inventory.

   *  KPIs: delay, jitter, loss

   *  Attachment Circuits (ACs) [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit]
      and [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit]

   *  Configuration: L2SM [RFC8466], L3SM [RFC8299], L2NM [RFC9291], and
      L3NM [RFC9182]

   *  Incident Management for Network Services
      [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang]
