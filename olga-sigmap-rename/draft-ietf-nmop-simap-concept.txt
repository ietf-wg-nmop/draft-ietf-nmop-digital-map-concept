1.  Introduction

   Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP) is a data model that provides a
   view of the operator's networks and services, including how it is
   connected to other models/data (e.g. inventory, observability
   sources, and operational knowledge).  It specifically provides an
   approach to model multi-layered topology and appropriate mechanism to
   navigate amongs layers and correlate between them.  This includes
   layers from physical topology to service topology.  This model is
   applicable to multiple domains (access, core, data centers, etc.) and
   technologies (Optical, IP, etc.).

   The SIMAP modelling defines the core topological entities (network,
   node, link, and interface) at each layer, their role in the network
   topology, core topological properties, and topological relationships
   both inside each layer and between the layers.  It also defines how
   to access other external models from the topology.

   The SIMAP model is a topological model that is linked to the other
   functional models and connects them all: configuration, maintenance,
   assurance (KPIs, status, health, and symptoms), Traffic-Engineering
   (TE), different behaviors and actions, simulation, emulation,
   mathematical abstractions, AI algorithms, etc.  These other models
   exist outside of the SIMAP and are not defined during SIMAP
   modelling.

   The SIMAP data consists of virtual instances of network and service
   topologies at different layers.  The SIMAP provides access to this
   data via standard APIs for both read and write operations (write
   operations for offline simulations), with query capabilities and
   links to other YANG modules (e.g., Service Assurance for Intent-based
   Networking (SAIN) [RFC9417], Service Attachement Points (SAPs)
   [RFC9408], Inventory [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang], and non-
   YANG models.

2.  Terminology

   The document makes use of the following terms:

   Topology:  Topology in this document refers to the network and
      service topology.  Network topology defines how physical or
      logical nodes, links and interfaces are related and arranged.
      Service topology defines how service components (e.g., VPN
      instances, customer interfaces, and customer links) between
      customer sites are interrelated and arranged.  There are at least
      8 types of topologies: point to point, bus, ring, star, tree,
      mesh, hybrid and daisy chain.  Topologies may be unidirectional or
      bidirectional (bus, some rings).

   Multi-layered topology:  A multi-layered topology models
      relationships between different layers of topology, where each
      layer represents a connectivity aspect of the network and services
      that needs to be configured, controlled and monitored.  Each layer
      of topology has a separate lifecycle.

   Topology layer:  Represents topology at a single layer in the multi-
      layered topology.

      The topology layer can also represent what needs to be managed by
      a specific user, for example IGP layer can be of interest to the
      operator troubleshooting or optimizing the routing, while the
      optical layer may be of interest to the user managing the optical
      network.

      Some topology layers may relate closely to OSI layers, like L1
      topology for physical topology, Layer 2 for link topology and
      Layer 3 for IPv4 and IPv6 topologies.

      Some topology layers represent the control aspects of Layer 3,
      like OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP.

      The service layer represents the service view of the connectivity,
      that can differ for different types of services and for different
      providers/solutions.

      The top layer represents the application/flow view of service
      connectivity.

   The document defines the following terms:

   Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP):  SIMAP is a data model that
      provides a view of the operator's networks and services, including
      how it is connected to other models/data (e.g. inventory,
      observability sources, and operational knowledge).  It
      specifically provides an approach to model multi-layered topology
      and appropriate mechanism to navigate amongs layers and correlate
      between them.  This includes layers from physical topology to
      service topology.

      This model is applicable to multiple domains (access, core, data
      centers, etc.) and technologies (Optical, IP, etc.).

   SIMAP modelling:  The set of principles, guidelines, and conventions
      to model the Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP) using the IETF
      [RFC8345] approach.  They cover the network types (layers and
      sublayers), entity types, entity roles (network, node, termination
      point or link), entity properties, relationship types between
      entities and relationships to other entities.

   SIMAP model:  Defines the core topological entities, their role in
      the network, core topological properties and relationships both
      inside each layer and between the layers.

      It is the basic topological model with the links to other models
      and connects them all: configuration, maintenance, assurance
      (KPIs, status, health, symptoms, etc.), traffic engineering,
      different behaviors, simulation, emulation, mathematical
      abstractions, AI algorithms, etc.

   SIMAP data:  Consists of instances of network and service topologies
      at different layers.  This includes instances of networks, nodes,
      links and termination points, topological relationships between
      nodes, links and termination points inside a network,
      relationships between instances belonging to different networks,
      links to functional data for the instances, including
      configuration, health, symptoms.

      The data can be historical, real-time, or future data for 'what-
      if' scenarios.

3.  Sample SIMAP Use Cases

   The following are sample use cases that require SIMAP:

   *  Generic inventory queries

   *  Service placement feasibility checks

   *  Service-> subservice -> resource

   *  Resource -> subservice -> service

   *  Intent/service assurance

   *  Service E2E and per-link KPIs on SIMAP (connectivity status, high-
      availability, delay, jitter, and loss)

   *  Capacity planning

   *  Network design

   *  Simulation

   *  Closed loop

   *  Digital Twin

   Overall, the SIMAP is needed to provide the mechanism to connect data
   islands from the core multi-layered topology.  It is a solution
   feasible and useful in the short-term for the existing operations use
   cases, but it is also a requirement for the SIMAP.

   The following sections includes some initial use case descriptions to
   initiate the discussion about what type of info is needed to describe
   the use cases in the context of SIMAP.  The next version of the draft
   will include more info on these use cases and more input from the
   operators, from the perspective of what the value of the SIMAP for
   each use case is and how the SIMAP API can be used.  This will also
   clarify if only read and if/when write interface is needed per use
   case.

3.1.  Generic inventory queries

   The application will be able to retrieve physical topology from the
   controller via SIMAP API and from the response it will be able to
   retrieve physical inventory of individual devices and cables.

   The application may request either one or multiple layers of topology
   via the SIMAP API and and from the response it will be able to
   retrieve both physical and logical inventory.

   For Access network providers the ability to have linkage in the SIMAP
   of the complete network (active + passive) is essential as it
   provides many advantages for optimized customer service, reduced
   MTTR, and lower operational costs through truck roll reduction.

3.2.  Service placement feasibility checks

3.3.  Service-> subservice -> resource

   The application will be able to retrieve all services from the SIMAP
   API for selected network types.  The application will be able to
   retrieve the topology for selected services via SIMAP API and from
   the response it will be able to navigate via the supporting
   relationship top-down to the lower layers.  That way, it will be able
   to determine what logical resources are used by the service.  The
   supporting relations to the lowest layer will help application to
   determine what physical resources are used by the service.

3.4.  Resource -> subservice -> service

   The application will be able to navigate from the Physical, L2 or L3
   topology to the services that use specific resources.  For example,
   the application will be able to select the resouce and by navigating
   the supporting relationship bottom-up come to the service and its
   nodes, tps and links.

3.5.  Intent/service assurance

   The application will be able to retrieve topology layer and any
   network/node/tp/link instances from the controller via the SIMAP API
   and from the response it will be able to determine the health of each
   instance by navigating to the SAIN subservices and its symptoms.

3.6.  Service E2E and per-link KPIs

   The application will be able to retieve the topology at any layer
   from the controller via the SIMAP API and from the response it will
   be able to navigate any retrieve any KPIs for selected topology
   entity.

3.7.  Capacity planning

3.8.  Network design

3.9.  Simulation

3.10.  Closed Loop

3.11.  Digital Twin

4.  SIMAP Requirements

4.1.  Core Requirements

   The following are the core requirements for the SIMAP (note that some
   of them are supported by default by [RFC8345]):

   REQ-BASIC-MODEL-SUPPORT:  Basic model with network, node, link, and
      interface entity types.

      This means that users of the SIMAP model must be able to
      understand topology model at any layer via these core concepts
      only, without having to go to the details of the specific
      augmentations to understand the topology.

   REQ-LAYERED-MODEL:  Layered SIMAP, from physical network (ideally
      optical, layer 2, layer 3) up to service and intent views.

   REQ-PASSIVE-TOPO:  SIMAP must support topology of the complete
      network, including active and passive parts.

      For Access network providers the ability to have linkage in the
      SIMAP of the complete network (active + passive) is essential as
      it provides many advantages for optimized customer service,
      reduced MTTR, and lower operational costs through truck roll
      reduction.

   REQ-PROG-OPEN-MODEL:  Open and programmable SIMAP.

      This includes "read" operations to retrieve the view of the
      network, typically as application-facing interface of Software
      Defined Networking (SDN) controllers or orchestrators.

      It also includes "write" operations, not for the ability to
      directly change the SIMAP data (e.g., changing the network or
      service parameters), but for offline simulations, also known as
      what-if scenarios.

      Running a "what-if" analysis requires the ability to take
      snapshots and to switch easily between them.

      Note that there is a need to distinguish between a change on the
      SIMAP for future simulation and a change that reflects the current
      reality of the network.

   REQ-STD-API-BASED:  Standard based SIMAP Models and APIs, for multi-
      vendor support.

      SIMAP must provide the standard YANG APIs that provide for read/
      write and queries.  These APIs must also provide the capability to
      retrieve the links to external data/models.

   REQ-COMMON-APP:  SIMAP models and APIs must be common over different
      network domains (campus, core, data center, etc.).

      This means that clients of the SIMAP API must be able to
      understand the topology model of layers of any domain without
      having to understand the details of any technologies and domains.

   REQ-SEMANTIC:  SIMAP must provide semantics for layered network
      topologies and for linking external models/data.

   REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE:  SIMAP must provide intra-layer and inter-layer
      relationships.

   REQ-EXTENSIBLE:  SIMAP must be extensible with metadata.

   REQ-PLUGG:  SIMAP must be pluggable.  That is,

      *  Must connect to other YANG modules for inventory,
         configuration, assurance, etc.

      *  Given that no all involved components can be available using
         YANG, there is a need to connect SIMAP YANG model with other
         modelling mechanisms.

   REQ-GRAPH-TRAVERSAL:  SIMAP must be optimized for graph traversal for
      paths.  This means that only providing link nodes and source and
      sink relationships to termination-points may not be sufficient, we
      may need to have the direct relationship between the termination
      points or nodes.

4.2.  Design Requirements

   The following are design requirements for modelling the SIMAP.  Theey
   are derived from the core requerements collected from the operators
   and although there is some duplication, these are focused on
   summarizing the requirements for the design of the model and API:

   REQ-TOPO-ONLY:  SIMAP should contain only topological information.

      SIMAP is not required to contain all models and data required for
      all the management and use cases.  However, it should be designed
      to support adequate pointers to other functional data and models
      to ease navigating in the overall system.  For example:

      *  ACLs and Route Policies are not required to be supported in the
         SIMAP, they would be linked to the SIMAP

      *  Dynamic paths may either be outside of the SIMAP or part of
         traffic engineering data/models

   REQ-PROPERTIES:  SIMAP entities should mainly contain properties used
      to identify topological entities at different layers, identify
      their roles, and topological relationships between them.

   REQ-RELATIONSHIPS:  SIMAP should contain all topological
      relationships inside each layer or between the layers (underlay/
      overlay)

      SIMAP should contain links to other models/data to enable generic
      navigation to other YANG models in generic way.

   REQ-CONDITIONAL:  Provide capability for conditional retrieval of
      parts of SIMAP.

   REQ-TEMPO-HISTO:  Must support geo-spatial, temporal, and historical
      data.  The temporal and historical can also be supported external
      to the SIMAP.

4.3.  Architectural Requirements

   The following are the architectural requirements for the controller
   that provides SIMAP API:

   REQ-DM-SCALES:  Scale, performance, ease of integration.

   REQ-DM-DISCOVERY:  Initial discovery and dynamic (change only) synch
      with the physical network.

5.  Security Considerations

   As this document covers the SIMAP concepts, requirements, and use
   cases, there is no specific security considerations.  However, the
   RFC 8345 Security Considerations aspects will be useful when
   designing the solution.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Related IETF Activities

A.1.  Network Topology

   Interestingly, we could not find any network topology definition in
   IETF RFCs (not even in [RFC8345]) or Internet-Drafts.  However, it is
   mentioned in multiple documents.  As an example, in Overview and
   Principles of Internet Traffic Engineering [RFC9522], which mentions:

   |  To conduct performance studies and to support planning of existing
   |  and future networks, a routing analysis may be performed to
   |  determine the paths the routing protocols will choose for various
   |  traffic demands, and to ascertain the utilization of network
   |  resources as traffic is routed through the network.  Routing
   |  analysis captures the selection of paths through the network, the
   |  assignment of traffic across multiple feasible routes, and the
   |  multiplexing of IP traffic over traffic trunks (if such constructs
   |  exist) and over the underlying network infrastructure.  A model of
   |  network topology is necessary to perform routing analysis.  A
   |  network topology model may be extracted from:
   |  
   |  *  Network architecture documents
   |  
   |  *  Network designs
   |  
   |  *  Information contained in router configuration files
   |  
   |  *  Routing databases such as the link state database of an
   |     interior gateway protocol (IGP)
   |  
   |  *  Routing tables
   |  
   |  *  Automated tools that discover and collate network topology
   |     information.
   |  
   |  Topology information may also be derived from servers that monitor
   |  network state, and from servers that perform provisioning
   |  functions.

A.2.  Core SIMAP Components

   The following specifications are core for the SIMAP:

   *  IETF network model and network topology model [RFC8345]

   *  A YANG grouping for geographic location [RFC9179]

   *  IETF modules that augment [RFC8345] for different technologies:

      -  A YANG data model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies
         [RFC8795]

      -  A YANG data model for Layer 2 network topologies [RFC8944]

      -  A YANG data model for OSFP topology
         [I-D.ogondio-opsawg-ospf-topology]

      -  A YANG data model for IS-IS topology
         [I-D.ogondio-nmop-isis-topology]

A.3.  Additional SIMAP Components

   The SIMAP may need to link to the following models, some are already
   augmenting [RFC8345]:

   *  Service Attachment Point (SAP) [RFC9408], augments 'ietf-network'
      data model [RFC8345] by adding the SAP.

   *  SAIN [RFC9417] [RFC9418]

   *  Network Inventory Model [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang]
      focuses on physical and virtual inventory.  Logical inventory is
      currently outside of the scope.  It does not augment RFC8345 like
      the two Internet-Drafts that it evolved from
      [I-D.ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang] and
      [I-D.wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management].
      [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology] correlates the network
      inventory with the general topology via RFC8345 augmentations that
      reference inventory.

   *  KPIs: delay, jitter, loss

   *  Attachment Circuits (ACs) [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit]
      and [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit]

   *  Configuration: L2SM [RFC8466], L3SM [RFC8299], L2NM [RFC9291], and
      L3NM [RFC9182]

   *  Incident Management for Network Services
      [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang]
